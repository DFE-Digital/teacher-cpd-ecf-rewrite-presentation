## Who am I?

* teacher CPD tech lead
* previously worked on [School Experience](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/schools-experience), [Curriculum materials](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/curriculum-materials/) and [Get Into Teaching](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/get-into-teaching-app)
* built and maintain some gems

## What is CPD? ðŸ¦’

- **ECF** stands for the Early Careers Framework
- **NPQ** stands for National Professional Qualifications
- **CPD** stands for Continuing Professional Development
- **CPD = ECF + NPQ**

## What are NPQs?

NPQs are voluntary qualifications that teachers can apply to do to further
their career.

They might help a teacher progress to being a head of department, an
expert in a particular subject or in becoming a headteacher.

## What is ECF?

All new teachers are _Early Career Teachers_ for the first two
years of their induction. During this time they have access
to a mentor and a set of training materials.

## Timeline

2020.
  - **November:** first commit to ECF repo
2021.
  - **March:**
    * induction tutor nomination beta
    * revised statutory guidance published
  - **April:** induction tutor nomination open for all schools
  - **July:**
    * registration opens for all schools
    * contracts with providers finalised
  - **September**:
    * peak registration
    * large helpdesk volumes
    * SLAs exceeded ðŸš¨

--- 

2022.
  - **May:** registration opens for all schools
  - **July:** I joined CPD ðŸ˜¬
  - **September---October:**
    * peak registration
    * critical helpdesk volumes
    * peaks at 3,000 open tickets ðŸ—»
    * people from other programmes needed to be drafted to help man Zendesk
    * SLAs exceeded ðŸš¨

---

2023.
  - **January:**
    * helpdesk volumes fall to pre-registration levels
    * feature development stops, focus shifts to fixing the app ready for next registration
  - **June:** registration opens for all schools
  - **September---October:**
    * peak registration
    * extra helpdesk staff and overtime means most SLAs met

## Observations

* only 5 months between the first commit and opening registration for all schools
* it took us nearly 5 months to recover after 2022's registration period
* no private beta ðŸ˜©
* our support queries in 2022 fell into two main categories:
  1. things which people wanted to but couldn't change via the user interface (numerous, shallow)
  2. data quality problems (few, deep)
* we spent the time between January and September 2023 fixing the shallow problems --- no new feature development
* **we can't solve the deep problems while running the service**

# The deeper problems

# Ownership

### Why is this bad?

* new functionality is implemented by teams to solve their own problems:
  - coordinating new features across teams takes extra effort
  - sometimes things developed in isolation overlap
  - when fields aren't intuitively named they're sometimes misused
* it introduces lots of questions like:
  - who is responsible for this data?
  - where should I report this bug?

---

* it makes releasing features that span teams/apps more complicated:
  - changes need to be planned far in advance
  - space needs to be found in every team's roadmap
  - new functionality needs to be feature flagged for coordinated releases
  - inter-app communication is hard to test in review apps

# The database

* tries to deal with two separate and very different policies
* doesn't do a great job of either
* not well normalised
* many data quality problems
* queries are often complex and inefficient
* uses single table inheritance ðŸ˜ž
* statuses are often calculated rather than stored, making querying and reporting difficult

Finding the current induction record is **a real problem**.

# Solving the deeper problems

# First, separating NPQ and ECF

---

## Solving the ownership problem

We're going to make NPQ a standalone service.

* two policies
* ~~three~~ two teams
* two repositories
* two databases
* ~~one~~ two APIs

## Improving things we do poorly in ECF

# Second, rewriting ECF

## We're about to start

There isn't really much to show yet, but we're starting **very soon**.

## Approach

* Use what we learnt during the NPQ separation
* Early focus on building tooling we can share between ECF and NPQ, like:
  - multi-step forms
  - admin structure and navigation
  - GOV.UK-style Swagger documentation
* Solve the most complicated data problems first
