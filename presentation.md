2023.

    * feature development stops, focus shifts to fixing the app ready for next registration
  - **June:** registration opens for all schools
  - **September---October:**
    * peak registration
    * extra helpdesk staff and overtime means most SLAs met

## Observations

* only 5 months between the first commit and opening registration for all schools
* it took us nearly 5 months to recover after 2022's registration period
* our support queries in 2022 fell into two main categories:
  1. things which people wanted to but couldn't change via the user interface (numerous, shallow)
  2. data quality problems (few, deep)
* we spent the time between January and September 2023 fixing the shallow problems --- no new feature development
* **we can't solve the deep problems while running the service**

# The deeper problems

# Ownership

### Why is this bad?

* new functionality is implemented by teams to solve their own problems:
  - coordinating new features across teams takes extra effort
  - sometimes things developed in isolation overlap
  - when fields aren't intuitively named they're sometimes misused
* it introduces lots of questions like:
  - who is responsible for this data?
  - where should I report this bug?

---

* it makes releasing features that span teams/apps more complicated:
  - changes need to be planned far in advance
  - space needs to be found in every team's roadmap
  - new functionality needs to be feature flagged for coordinated releases
  - inter-app communication is hard to test in review apps

# The database

* tries to deal with two separate and very different policies
* doesn't do a great job of either
* not well normalised
* many data quality problems
* queries are often complex and inefficient
* uses single table inheritance ðŸ˜ž
* statuses are often calculated rather than stored, making querying and reporting difficult

Finding the current induction record is **a real problem**.
